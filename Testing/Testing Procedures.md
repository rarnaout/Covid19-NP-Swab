# Mechanical Testing Procedures
1) static load breaking test
   - fix distal end of swab
   - apply static load to bristle-end
   - measure breaking with load
   - ensure breaking occurs at at snap-point, not on bristle shaft or bristle head

2) dynamic load breaking test
   - fix distal end of swab
   - apply static load to bristle-end
   - measure breaking with load
   - ensure breaking occurs at at snap-point, not on bristle shaft or bristle head
   
3) static load bending test 
   - fix distal end of swab
   - apply static load to bristle-end
   - measure bending angel with load
   - ensure swab bends and flexes less than maximum angle
   TODO: *specify maximum angle-per-load constraints* (e.g. 75 degrees and XX Newtons)

4) dynamic load bending test
   TODO: *define this*

# Chemical Testing Procedures
1) test that swab absorbs viral RNA particles
2) test that swab does not interfere with PCA/reagents


# Absorption Testing Procedures
1) quantify amount of absorption
   TODO: *quantify absorption of current swabs and test against current/old standard*
   - fill vials with fluid (what viscosity / chemical composition to simulate nasopharyx fluid?)
   - measure volume of absorption over certain time period (TODO: *assume 5 seconds?*)
